        <h2><b>Name: </b>Beau Travis</h2>
        <h2><b>Preference: </b>Beau, or Travis. Either works.</h2>
        <p>Thats the nice thing about having two 'first' names.</p>
        <p>Beau is from Southern CA, doesn't really like to share his photo, and is a SCADA Specialist in the Water/Wastewater industry. 
            Originally, he attended UCSD for Pre-Med and then served a mission in England (Leeds Mission).
            He is married, working full-time, and now studying... so no hobbies anymore. 
        </p>
        <p>A large component of a SCADA system is a graphical front end that an Operator can interface with. 
            So over the last 10 years Beau has seen a miriad of different graphical approaches.
            These range from navigation types, colour schemes, content layouts, etc. 
            A page (web or otherwise) can look really pretty, but at the end of the day is only as effective as it is intuitive.
            So in this course, Beau is looking to further expand this concept and take some new ideas back to work.
