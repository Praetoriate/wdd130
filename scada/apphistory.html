                Where do you find SCADA Systems? EEEeeeeeeverywhere… But seriously, nearly every production or industrial process utilizes some flavour of SCADA system to monitor their controls.

                SCADA History Lesson: SCADA Systems started being implemented in the 1960’s to allow for more control and visibility to the equipment and processes. The term was first coined in the 70’s. There are 4 main ‘generations’ of SCADA approach that have evolved with the availability of newer technologies. Monolithic (single main-frame control) Distributed (localized controllers ‘distributed’ through the process) Networked (controllers and equipment communicating over a local network) Web-based (control data made accessible through web-browsers, data can be displayed from global sources) SCADA is a flavour of automation that is differentiated by its focus on operator input and data collection. Complete automation is often associated with the elimination of the need for people to be involved in the process. SCADA Systems enable operators/personnel to be more effective in their duties.
